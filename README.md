# Eugenda

Eugenda is a personal project made with <strong>Django</strong> & <strong>Django REST framework (DRF)</strong> with the sole purpose of practice and learning. Everything was made by myself, Vinícius Eugênio.

In the making of this project I was able to understand better the concepts of an API, as well the functioning of Django views. As I started the project using Function-Based Views (FBV) and slowly improved to Class-Based Views (CBV), I was able to get a better understanding about how it all works behind the scenes with CBV and how to implement it by hand. This facilitated my comprehension of the code. I got a better understanding also about Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and how to prevent it, as well about Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and how to allow it within Django configuration.

In <strong>Eugenda</strong> you are able to save, exclude or edit your contacts. They are separated by categories, which are two: Friend or family. You also have a search bar in the top of the page to encouter a person faster. Moreover, the project has its REST API side, made with DRF to allow the making of a front-end by a separated framework, such as React.js.

The contact model is formed by:

- Name
- Surname
- Phone
- E-mail
- Date of creation
- Description
- Category
- Image

If you have any tips for improvement, whether in front or back-end, feel free to open a PR or message me in the LinkedIn!
